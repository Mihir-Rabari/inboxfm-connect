 * Issue #178 — the fork rebranded Activepieces -> Inboxfm Connect, but the sweep
 * was done file-by-file and pieces kept being added afterwards. Several strings
 * that users actually see survived: the webhook names created inside a customer's
 * Zendesk project ("Activepieces New Ticket Webhook - 1712..."), the app name
 * shown in Zoho CRM, and the setup instructions in the YouTrack and
 * YouCanBookMe piece docs.
 *
 * This scans the integration packages and fails if a user-visible "Activepieces"
 * string reappears, so the rebrand cannot silently rot as pieces are added.
